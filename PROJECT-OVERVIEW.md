# 🚀 Jason's Personal Website - Project Overview
*Last Updated: June 1, 2025*

## 🎯 Mission & Goals

### **Primary Mission**
Create a modern, data-driven personal website that showcases JJ Roberts's expertise as a relationship advice expert. 

The name of his book is Sex 2.0 and the primary aim of the website is lead capture and grow his audience in a viral manner via the built in referral system and reward points called "Insight Gems" that people get for referrals and performing other tasks.

Once a person is subscribed via the ConvertKit API
(convert kit has now changed its name to just kit). they will be taken on a guided journey from 2.0 to 3.0 and will receive emails with web, audio or video content to help them along this journey. There will also be interfactive content as we "gamify" the journey to make it more fun and insighful.

Along the way we will sell them products and their email sequence and path will branch on whether they buy or don't buy and whether the take certain actions or don't take certains actions like spending insight gems, unlocking content etc.

The dashboard is where JJ will oversee the growth of the business and monitor user journies. This requires serving as a testing ground for advanced web analytics, A/B testing, and user engagement strategies using supabase.
