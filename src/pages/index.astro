  JJ Roberts is a pioneering voice in relationship psychology, dedicated to helping individuals escape the frustrating cycles of conventional relationships. For years, JJ experienced firsthand the limitations and disappointments of traditional relationship models—a system fraught with unspoken rules and inevitable conflict. This personal journey culminated in an enlightening two-year research trip across more than 40 countries, a quest to understand the true nature of human connection beyond societal conditioning. <br/><br/>
  This global exploration led to profound breakthroughs and the deconstruction of outdated relationship paradigms. JJ saw clearly the flawed design inherent in the common approach to love and intimacy—a system that often breeds misunderstanding, jealousy, and pain.
`;
const aboutJJExpertDescription2 = `
  From these realisations, the revolutionary modern framework for relationships was born, offering a path to connections built on radical honesty, conscious choice, and genuine freedom. <br/><br/>
  JJ's work, including the groundbreaking book "Sex 3.0: The Relationship Upgrade", provides a clear blueprint for this upgraded approach. It has already transformed the lives of people worldwide, guiding them from confusion and disappointment to clarity, empowerment, and deeply fulfilling partnerships that truly align with their authentic selves.
